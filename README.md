Dungeon crawler game written in python.

## Getting started
- Install python (3.6 or 3.7)
> It's not recommended to use Homebrew python when using MacOS Mojave because of this known [issue](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/555). Use the official releases instead.
- Install pip
- Install required libraries
```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
- After this you should be able to play by running the main.py file.
```bash
python main.py
```

## Creating your own levels
- Creating your own levels is quite simple. You can edit the [map.txt](src/dungeon/maps/map.txt) file.
